# jQuery Server Side Calculator

Duration: 15-20 hours

## Description

This is your standard calculator. As for right now it is a basic calculator that can handle, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two numbers. 

When you open the app, you simply enter a number in the first input field, choose a math operator, then enter a second number in the other input field and hit the `=` button to do the calculation. This will send the equation over to the server, where my app will do the math, and then send the answer back to the client, displaying on the page the most recent answer, as well as all of the previous calculations made. There is a `C` button to clear the current input fields, and there is an even more serious `Delete` button that will delete any old calculations currently being stored on the server.
